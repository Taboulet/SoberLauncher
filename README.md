# SoberLauncher
An easy launcher to control all your Sober Instances

This is a way to create profiles for Sober and run them all at the same time using environnement variables

⚠️ Clear limitation
This is a basic project made by me, i'll fix the issues but don't expect a perfect app made by a big team and stuff
This is made with python, to launch it just double click on the "SoberLauncher.py" file (try to make it executable if it's not for some reason)
This is mainly made for steamos, this will of course work on other distros but for now this won't be perfect
The "Launch with console" button works only with "Konsole", i need to fix it but i'll do it later lol
(Might've used a lil bit of ai to create this)
